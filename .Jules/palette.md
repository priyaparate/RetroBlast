**Learning:** The application's retro aesthetic relies heavily on minimalist forms with placeholders instead of visible labels. While visually clean, this is a major accessibility barrier for screen reader users.
**Action:** In future retro-themed forms, if visible labels compromise the design, ALWAYS apply `aria-label` attributes to inputs that match their placeholders to ensure accessibility without breaking the visual style.
