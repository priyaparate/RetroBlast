## 2025-05-21 - Accessible Form Inputs
**Learning:** This app heavily relies on placeholders for form inputs without visible labels. While visually "clean" for the retro aesthetic, it creates an accessibility barrier.
**Action:** Always add `aria-label` matching the placeholder text to such inputs to ensure screen readers can announce the field purpose without disrupting the visual design.
